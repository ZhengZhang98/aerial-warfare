# Aerial-Warfare

This is a shooting game which is designed to be object-oriented using JAVA. The idea starts with the popular mobile game called "飞机大战". I redesigned the game into PC version, with some new features like creating the bees as the bonus enemies for ramdomly getting the bonus life or more powerful weapon.
